## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Whenever you're using images or any asset in your React app, be sure to import them or else your application will break in production mode.

```jsx
import avatar from './src/assets/images/avatar.jpg'

<img src={avatar} alt="avatar">
```

### Custom Features

1. Automatic Dark Mode
2. Sticky navbar on mobile

### Continued development

[] - Notifications on performing actions

### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/) - React's Documentation is the best place to learn about it.
- [John Smilga's React Course](https://youtu.be/2-crBg6wpp0?si=8c52G9we2-f3YX_4) - This course is splendid for beginners.
